X Factor (UK) - Flying Without Wings Lyrics,Everybodys looking for that something One thing that makes it all complete Youll find it in the strangest places Places you never knew it could be Some find it in the face of their children Some find it in their lovers eyes Who can deny the joy it brings When youve found that special thing? Youre flying without wings Some find it sharing every morning Some in their solitary lives Youll find it in the words of others A simple line can make you laugh or cry Youll find it in the deepest friendship The kind you cherish all your life And when you know how much that means Youve found that special thing Youre flying without wings So impossible as it may seem Youve got to fight for every dream Cause whos to know which one you let go Would have made you complete Well for me its waking up beside you To watch the sunrise on your face To know that I can say I love you In any given time or place Gives me the wings that only I know Those are the things that make you mine And its like flying without wings Cause youre my special thing Im flying without wings And youre the place my life begins And youll be where it ends Im flying without wings And thats the joy you bring Im flying without wings

So You Think You Can Dance - Fix You Lyrics,When you try your best but you dont succeed When you get what you want but not what you need When you feel so tired but you cant sleep Stuck in reverse And the tears come streaming down your face When you lose something you cant replace When you love someone but it goes to waste Could it be worse?

Glee Cast - The Music of the Night Lyrics,Night time sharpens heightens each sensation Darkness stirs and wakes imagination Silently the senses abandon their defenses Slowly gently night unfurls its splendor Grasp it sense it tremulous and tender Turn your face away from the garish light of day Turn your thoughts away from cold unfeeling light And listen to the music of the night Close your eyes and surrender to your darkest dreams Purge your thoughts of the life you knew before Close your eyes let your spirit start to soar And you live as youve never lived before Softly deftly music shall caress you Hear it feel it secretly possess you Open up your mind let your fantasies unwind In this darkness that you know you cannot fight The darkness of the music of the night Let your mind start a journey to a strange new world Leave all thoughts of the life you knew before Let your soul take you where you long to be Only then can you belong to me Floating falling sweet intoxication Touch me trust me savor each sensation Let the dream begin let your darker side give in To the power of the music that I write The power of the music of the night You alone can make my song take flight Help me make the music of the night
National Anthem Orchestra - Ireland Anthem Text Lyrics,Soldiers Song Well sing song a soldiers song With cheering rousing chorus As round our blazing fires we throng The starry heavens oer us; Impatient for the coming fight And as we wait the mornings light Here in the silence of the night Well chant a soldiers song. Chorus Soldiers are we whose lives are pledged to Ireland; Some have come from a land beyond the wave. Sworn to be free No more our ancient sire land Shall shelter the despot or the slave. Tonight we man the gap of danger In Erins cause come woe or weal Mid cannons roar and rifles peal Well chant a soldiers song In valley green on towering crag Our fathers fought before us And conquered neath the same old flag Thats proudly floating oer us. Were children of a fighting race That never yet has known disgrace And as we march the foe to face Well chant a soldiers song Chorus Sons of the Gael! Men of the Pale! The long watched day is breaking; The serried ranks of Inisfail Shall set the Tyrant quaking. Our camp fires now are burning low; See in the east a silvry glow Out yonder waits the Saxon foe So chant a soldiers song. Chorus Sent by Carlos Andr Pereira da Silva Branco

Sammy Davis Jr. - Gonna Build A Mountain Lyrics,Gonna build a mountain from a little hill Gonna build me a mountain least I hope I will. Gonna build a mountain. Gonna build it high. I dont know how Im gonna do it. I only know Im gonna try. Gonna build me a daydream. From a little hope. Gonna push that daydream. Up the mountain slope. Gonna build a daydream. Gonna see it through. Gonna build a mountain and a daydream. Gonna make them both come true. Gonna build a heaven. From a little hell. Gonna build me a heaven. And I know darn well. If I build my mountain with a lot of care. And take my daydream up the mountain. And heaven will be waiting there. When I build that heaven as I will someday. And the lord sees Gabriel to take me away. What a fine young son to take my place. Id leave a son in my heaven on earth. With the good lords praise. Gonna build a mountain.
Dancing with the Stars - Strangers in the Night Lyrics,Strangers in the night exchanging glances Wondering in the night What were the chances wed be sharing love Before the night was through Something in your eyes was so inviting Something in your smile was so exciting Something in my heart told me I must have you Strangers in the night two lonely people We were strangers in the night Up to the moment when we said our first hello Little did we know Love was just a glance away A warm embracing dance away And ever since that night weve been together Lovers at first sight in love forever It turned out so right for strangers in the night Love was just a glance away A warm embracing dance away Ever since that night weve been together Lovers at first sight in love forever It turned out so right for strangers in the night
Luciano Pavarotti - My Way Lyrics,And now the end is near And so I face the final curtain. My friend Ill say it clear Ill state my case of which Im certain. Ive lived a life thats full. Ive traveled each and evry highway; But more much more than this I did I did it my way Regrets Ive had a few But then again too few to mention. I did what I had to do And saw it through without exemption. I planned each charted course Each careful step along the byway But more much much more I did I did it my way Yes there were times Im sure you knew When I bit off more than I could chew. But through it all when there was doubt I ate it up and spit it out. I faced it all and I stood tall And did it my way For what is a man what has he got? If not himself then he has naught. To say the things he truly feels And not the words of one who kneels. The record shows I took the blows And did it my way!
Count Basie - Come Fly With Me Lyrics,Come fly with me lets fly lets fly away If you can use some exotic booze Theres a bar in far Bombay Come fly with me lets fly lets fly away Come fly with me lets float down to Peru In llama land theres a one man band And hell toot his flute for you Come fly with me lets take off in the blue Once I get you up there Where the air is rarefied Well just glide Starry eyed Once I get you up there Ill be holding you so near You may hear Angels cheer cause were together Weather wise its such a lovely day Just say the words and well beat the birds Down to Acapulco Bay It is perfect for a flying honeymoon they say Come fly with me lets fly lets fly away Once I get you up there Where the air is rarefied Well just glide Starry eyed Once I get you up there Ill be holding you so near You may hear Angels cheer cause were together Weather wise its such a lovely day You just say the words and well beat the birds Down to Acapulco Bay Its perfect for a flying honeymoon they say Come fly with me lets fly lets fly Pack up lets fly away

Glee Cast - The Music of the Night Lyrics,Night time sharpens heightens each sensation Darkness stirs and wakes imagination Silently the senses abandon their defenses Slowly gently night unfurls its splendor Grasp it sense it tremulous and tender Turn your face away from the garish light of day Turn your thoughts away from cold unfeeling light And listen to the music of the night Close your eyes and surrender to your darkest dreams Purge your thoughts of the life you knew before Close your eyes let your spirit start to soar And you live as youve never lived before Softly deftly music shall caress you Hear it feel it secretly possess you Open up your mind let your fantasies unwind In this darkness that you know you cannot fight The darkness of the music of the night Let your mind start a journey to a strange new world Leave all thoughts of the life you knew before Let your soul take you where you long to be Only then can you belong to me Floating falling sweet intoxication Touch me trust me savor each sensation Let the dream begin let your darker side give in To the power of the music that I write The power of the music of the night You alone can make my song take flight Help me make the music of the night
National Anthem Orchestra - Ireland Anthem Text Lyrics,Soldiers Song Well sing song a soldiers song With cheering rousing chorus As round our blazing fires we throng The starry heavens oer us; Impatient for the coming fight And as we wait the mornings light Here in the silence of the night Well chant a soldiers song. Chorus Soldiers are we whose lives are pledged to Ireland; Some have come from a land beyond the wave. Sworn to be free No more our ancient sire land Shall shelter the despot or the slave. Tonight we man the gap of danger In Erins cause come woe or weal Mid cannons roar and rifles peal Well chant a soldiers song In valley green on towering crag Our fathers fought before us And conquered neath the same old flag Thats proudly floating oer us. Were children of a fighting race That never yet has known disgrace And as we march the foe to face Well chant a soldiers song Chorus Sons of the Gael! Men of the Pale! The long watched day is breaking; The serried ranks of Inisfail Shall set the Tyrant quaking. Our camp fires now are burning low; See in the east a silvry glow Out yonder waits the Saxon foe So chant a soldiers song. Chorus Sent by Carlos Andr Pereira da Silva Branco

Robert Greenidge - Winter Wonderland Lyrics,Sleigh bells ring are you listening In the lane snow is glistening A beautiful sight were happy tonight Walking in a winter wonderland Sleigh bells ring are you listening In the lane snow is glistening A beautiful sight were happy tonight Walking in a winter wonderland Gone away is the bluebird Here to stay is the new bird He sings a love song as we go along Walking in a winter wonderland In the meadow we can build a snowman And pretend that he is Parson Brown Hell say Are you married? Well say No man But you can do the job when youre in town Later on well conspire as we dream by the fire To face unafraid the plans that weve made Walking in a winter wonderland Walking in a winter wonderland In the meadow we can build a snowman And pretend that hes a circus clown Well have lots of fun with Mr. Snowman Until the other kids knock him down When it snows aint it thrilling Though your nose gets a chilling Well frolic and play the Eskimo way Walking in a winter wonderland Well sing a love song as we go along Walking in a winter wonderland Oh walking in a winter wonderland Well be walking in a winter wonderland
